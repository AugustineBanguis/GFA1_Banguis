	<h1>Philippine Cancer Society</h1>
	<p>Imagine your body suddenly going against you by growing cells that harm you to the point that parts of your body start bulging, stange growths start appearing, and your very lifespan is shortened. That is cancer, and I support the research and the treatments against it made by the Philippine Cancer Society.</p>
	<p>I chose this charity because:</p>
	<ul> 
		<li>I have lost a friend to cancer before and currently have one suffering to it. Supporting this charity is my chance to honor their memory and help save others that are suffering from it</li>
		<li>I seek for a future where cancer can be as curable as the common cold and donating to the research efforts is most likely a step in the right direction.</li>
		<li>I wish to help people who don't have much time left, live their lives to the fullest and happiest they can be with the ones they love.</li>
	</ul>
